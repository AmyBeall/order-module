    // BEGIN: Modals Layout.
    // --
    // Our simple modal system makes the assumption that only one modal window can be
    // open at a time. I find this to be a very reasonable assumption for 99% of use-
    // cases. And, I'd rather keep it simple and work around the rare use-case in some
    // other fashion (such as a multi-state modal).
    // To remove any "magic", I'm explicitly presenting the control properties rather
    // than trying to hide them behind a compile() step. Notice that rendering a modal
    // is JUST LIKE RENDERING ANY OTHER VIEW - we have a subview variable which we are
    // using to swap modals, or remove modals altogether.
    // The big take-away in the following code is that modal windows aren't a *special*
    // concept. They are views or components that work the same exact way that the rest
    // of your application works! Sure, there are a few more rules, like only one open
    // at a time; but, other than that, there's nothing here that's any different than
    // any other view you will build. It has a Controller, it has a View, and it works
    // with other services to execute its functionality.
